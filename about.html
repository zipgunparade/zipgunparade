					<h2>GET TO KNOW ME.</h2>
							<p>I am passionate about bringing ideas to life with design, showcasing the best side of a subject through photography, and enjoying performance art by attending as many live music shows as possible. There is inspiration everywhere and I try to do what I can with what I have around me. </p>

					<h2>HOW DID I GET HERE?</h2>
							<p>I've had an interest in web design ever since I was a kid, but that wasn't the career path I pursued when I was growing up. I still did web and graphic design throughout my college years, but only for a hobby or as a freelancer. When I was old enough, I started working in the bar and restaurant industry in Chicago and stuck with it while waiting to complete the lengthy steps of the Chicago Police hiring process. </p>

							<p>With bars and restaurants shut down during the pandemic, and no word on my CPD application, I went into panic mode and applied for every job opportunity available. Somehow ended up as an EMS student working as a pharmacy technician for Walgreens. Even though I excelled in both of those roles, I decided the medical field was absolutely not for me and jumped at the first opportunity to work at my old jobs when bars and restaurants reopened.</p>

							<p>Throughout the years working in the bar and restaurant industry, in roles from server to manager, I've designed merchandise, photographed menu items, and maintained websites and POS systems, keeping them up to date and free of errors. </p>

							<p>Wanting to learn more about design and catch up on technological advancements, I enrolled in a UX/UI course on Coursera. After completing the course, I wanted to expand my knowledge further. I re-enrolled in school and am currently pursuing an Advanced Certificate in Web Development from Truman College.</p>
